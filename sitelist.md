## **Unsafe Site List:**

igg-games.com / pcgamestorrents.com / gamestorrent.co The main reasons why igg-games is not recommended is due to their history of shady behavior, such as including their own form of DRM into their .dll files.

BBRepacks - Fake BlackBox Repacks, contain malware.

OceanOfGames - High malware risk.

xGIROx - repacks contain bitcoin miners.

Seyter - repacks contain bitcoin miners.

cracked-games.org - Malware Risk.

crackingpatching - Malware Risk.

Steamunlocked - Slow downloads, malicious link redirects & uploads stolen releases from other unsafe sites.

The Pirate Bay - Malware Risk.

Kickass Torrents - Malware Risk.

Any website using the name of a Scene group (such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA, etc.). Scene groups do not have public websites. If you find a site using the name of a scene group, they are impersonators. (2 notable exceptions are https://skidrowrepacks.com, and https://skidrowcodex.net, which are fine to use, though they are still impostor sites).
