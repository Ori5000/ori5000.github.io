**Download Adobe Software from Monkrus.ws**

This guide will show you how to download from <https://w14.monkrus.ws/>.

**Browsing Part**
**(1)** Open <https://w14.monkrus.ws/> in your browser, and scroll down until you see a search bar, here search the name of the software you're interested in and click enter.
**(2)** At the top of the new page you got into, you will see a gray box with some text inside, search and click the text saying "`Ð¡Ð¾Ñ€Ñ‚Ð¸Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ñ‚ÑŒ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð´Ð°Ñ‚Ðµ`" to Sort by date in order to get the latest version of the software, and click the page you're interested in.
**(3)** Scroll down until you see a list of URLs for torrent trackers, I recommend clicking the UNIONDHT.ORG link as it has the most seeders and requires no user.
**(4)** Now click on the `Download .torrent` or the Magnet (ðŸ§²) Button and start torrenting as usual, when the torrent finished downloading run or extract the `.iso` file and then run `autoplay.exe`, and that's it!

**Enjoy your new Adobe software, and most importantly - don't forget to seed!**
