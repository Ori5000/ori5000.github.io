# **The Full Pandabuy Guide - Buy Expensive For Cheap**

Have you ever wanted to buy a product, whether it's some nice T-Shirt, Shoes, or even jewelry, but then you looked at the product's price tag and didn't realize WTF is that? In that case Pandabuy is exactly what you need!

## **What is Pandabuy?**
Pandabuy is an agent that connects between you and Chinese sellers of Chinese goods, including replicas of clothing, tech, jewelry and more. Replicas are items which look and feel identical to expensive brand items, for cheap, with very high quality!
When ordering products with Pandabuy, the product passes thru Pandabuy's warehouse, where it's quality is getting checked and you will get pictures of the product, if you found a defect or just don't like the product, you can return it!

## **How do I order from Pandabuy?**

### **1. Signing Up & Get Unlimited 5% Shipping Discount**
First of all, you need to sign up to Pandabuy with [this link](https://www.pandabuy.com/login?inviteCode=835LEGX9D), after creating your account successfully you can use the infinite 5% shipping discount code "`nick`".

### **2. How to Find The Product I want?**
There are a couple of ways to find the product you want, you can type it's name in the search bar or search by image, but this way you won't always be satisfied with the product's quality. I recommend the 3rd way, which is looking in online Replica communities. There are a lot of people reviewing the products they bought, so if you like their product, you can copy it's link and paste it in the search bar. In these communities you can also find Spreadsheets which contains a list of recommended products. One more thing in the communities is to ask W2C (Where to Cop) the product you want.
The Communities I recommend are:

### **4. How to avoid taxes?**
US / Canda: Customs are pretty relaxed in these countries. shipping hauls up to 10kg generally isn't a problem there. Some people even do more. Do so at your own risk. For the USA, the declaration value doesn't matter much, as you are unlikely to be taxed. For Canada, declare the package 10-14USD. Also, If you live in Canada, it is advised that you use EMS or GD-SAL. If you use DHL, you will be taxed upon package arrival.

Europe Checklist: You may have to look up laws for any import fees or regulations. These numbers are an example for shipping to Germany, it should work for any country though.
* Stay within .9 of a KG. Read here for more information
* Try to stay at a maximum of 4kg. Do not go over this for the safest rate.
* If possible ask for no cardboard wrapping, let them package in DHL plastic bag
* Ask for vacuum sealing (Possible in the fewest cases)
* Ask them to wrap up your whole package with tape, a lot of tape.
* Let them put a Commercial invoice on the outside (!)! of your package
* The commercial invoice should have a value UNDER $24 including shipping costs
* The commercial invoice has to be readable, if it has printing errors it has to be printed again
* The commercial invoice has to state the shipping costs with a value >$0
* The commercial invoice has to have a sender address
* Your telephone number has to be stated on the commercial invoice
* Let them send you a copy of the commercial invoice to your email (Will come back to this)

**It is strongly advised that you go to Google and type in "[Your country] customs fashionreps/pandabuy".**

## **Pandabuy Shipping Tips**
* Watch [this shipping costs guide post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/acw6nk/as_requested_a_short_explanation_to_superbuy), it talks about Superbuy (like Pandabuy but worse), but it's the same for Pandabuy.
* You can ship shoeboxes - Do not ship more than 2 shoeboxes in one package
* You can ship as many packages as you want simultaneously
* Think twice before shipping shoeboxes, if you don't need them, don't ship them and Pandabuy will throw them away. They're heavy and require volumetric weight.
* If you have a non-Rep haul then you can probably use other shipping methods. Decide on your own.
* If Pandabuy does not let you pay for your replicas directly through Paypal, just top up your account balance and then pay through your balance.
