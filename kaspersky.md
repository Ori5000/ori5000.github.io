## **Full Kaspersky Products (Internet Security, Anti-Virus, Total Security, etc) Installation & Cracking Guide**



This guide will show you how to fully install & crack Kaspersky products, currently the best Anti-virus in my opinion. Let's get started!



## **Installation Part**

**(1)** The first part in this guide, is installing the product, for this guide is choosing the product you want to install (I recommend Kaspersky Internet Security), go to https://kaspersky.com/downloads and choose click the **Try free** Button of the product you want (a red big button, you may need to scroll down to see it).

**(2)** Once the download of the .exe is done, run the .exe and follow it instructions.

*Note: **DO NOT EVER LOGIN/REGISTER IN THE SOFTWARE**



## **Cracking Part**

**(1)** After you finished the installation part of the guide, you should download the software patcher from here: https://krakenfiles.com/view/kQIxuqMKz0/file.html (Make sure to disable anti-virus, because of this file can be detected as a virus, false-positive.)

**(2)** Download one of these files, depends your product:

For Kaspersky Internet Security: https://krakenfiles.com/view/Llh3Sxj3So/file.html

For Kaspersky Total Security: https://krakenfiles.com/view/7fWMkAYYEN/file.html

For Kaspersky Anti-Virus: https://krakenfiles.com/view/0aDoC9oU2C/file.html

**(3)** Go to Kaspersky `Settings -> General -> Untick The âœ… Of "Enable Self-Defense"`, Close & Exit Kaspersky in the system tray.

**(4)** Extract & Run KRT_CLUB as administrator (from above), Choose the second option in the software (Icon of Arrow up with the text "LIC" &), Click "**__Reset Activation__**" And choose the .lic file you downloaded (from step 2).



**And that's it! you can close now the KRT_CLUB & open Kaspersky again, you can see now that you have an active license! Enjoy Kaspersky!**
