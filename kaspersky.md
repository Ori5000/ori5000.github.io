## **Full Kaspersky Products Installation & Cracking Guide**



This guide will show you how to fully install & crack Kaspersky products, currently the best Anti-virus in my opinion. Let's get started!



## **Installation Part**

**(1)** The first part in this guide, is installing the product, for this guide is choosing the product you want to install (I recommend Kaspersky Internet Security),  go to https://pastebin.com/raw/0GsjrZw8, select the product that you want and click **Download**.

**(2)** Once the download of the .exe is done, run the .exe and follow it instructions.

*Note: **DO NOT EVER LOGIN/REGISTER IN THE SOFTWARE**



## **Cracking Part**

**(1)** After you finished the installation part of the guide, you should download the software patcher from here: https://krakenfiles.com/view/4tWBUvxel8/file.html (Make sure to disable anti-virus, because of this file can be detected as a virus, false-positive.)

**(2)** Download one of these files, depends your product:

For Kaspersky Anti-Virus / Basic: https://krakenfiles.com/view/H1YqzCesFo/file.html

For Kaspersky Internet Security / Standard: https://krakenfiles.com/view/444987a8c1/file.html

For Kaspersky Total Security / Plus: https://krakenfiles.com/view/35820908f6/file.html

**(3)** Go to Kaspersky `Settings -> General -> Untick The âœ… Of "Enable Self-Defense"`, Close & Exit Kaspersky in the system tray.

**(3 for Basic/Standard/Plus)** In Kaspersky Basic / Standard / Plus the simplest way to disable Self-Defense is to boot the computer into safe-mode google that.

**(4)** Extract & Run Kaspersky Tweak Assistant (Password: `Bambang`) as administrator (from above), Click LICENSE then IMPORT in the software and choose the .lic file you downloaded (from step 2).

**And that's it! you can close now Kaspersky Tweak Assistant & open Kaspersky again and you can see now that you have an activated license! Enjoy Kaspersky!**
